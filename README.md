LogCatColumnizer
================

Columnizer for LogExpert. Parses Android logcat logs in following format:

<h3>Saved logs</h3>
Logs that were generated by selecting some lines in Eclipse, Android monitor app or Android Studio and saved as log file.

<h3>Output from 'adb logcat -v time'</h3>
Thi parses output from logcat so it can be used instead of logcat in Android Studio that doesn't use columns as logcat in Eclipse. Unfortunately this output contains empty lines between log lines and LogExpert can't process it correctly. I use PowerShell to pre-process the file - remove empty lines.

```
powershell "adb logcat -v time|where {$_ -ne ''}|Out-File logcat.log"
```

This command stores adjusted output from logcat to logcat.log file. This file can be directly opened with LogExpert.


Currently only 'time' format of logcat output is supported.

<h3>Out specific format of logs</h3>
It is also capable to parse our specific logs that includes method name and line. It has to be in following format:

```
12-31 17:26:46.268: <level>/<class tag>(<TID>): <log message>[<method>():<line>]
```

Example:

```
12-31 17:26:46.268: D/MediaDownloader(3012): Track wasn't changed[add():159]
```


<h2>Support of deobfuscation</h2>
Class tag can be logged as full class name (to be able do the deobfuscation). Columnizer shows only the simple name.

Example:

```
com.company.foo.SomeClass is shown as SomeClass only
```
